						Adults in their middle years actually enjoy a rich variety of
						activities. Although middle adulthood often represents the peak of
						career success and earning power, it is also a time when people
						throw themselves into leisure and recreational activities. In fact,
						midlife may be the period when work and leisure activities are
						balanced most easily. No longer feeling a need to prove themselves
						on the job, and increasingly valuing their contributions to family,
						community, and—more broadly—society, middle-aged adults may find
						that work and leisure complement one another in ways that enhance
						overall happiness.
