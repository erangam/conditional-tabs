							If we look at more specific types of intelligence, other
							age-related differences and developments begin to show up.
							According to developmental psychologist K. Warner Schaie, who has
							conducted extensive longitudinal research on adult intellectual
							development, we should consider many types of ability, such as
							spatial orientation, numeric ability, verbal ability, and so on,
							rather than the broad divisions of crystallized and fluid
							intelligence (<a

							Examined this way, the question of how intelligence changes in
							adulthood yields yet another, more specific, answer. Schaie has
							found that certain abilities, such as inductive reasoning, spatial
							orientation, perceptual speed, and verbal memory, begin to decline
							gradually at around age 25 and continue to do so through old age.
							Numeric and verbal abilities show a different pattern. Numeric
							ability tends to increase until the mid-40s, is lower at age 60,
							and then remains steady. Verbal ability rises until the start of
							middle adulthood, around age 40, then stays fairly steady (<a

							Why do these changes occur? One reason is that brain functioning
							begins to change in middle adulthood. For example, researchers
							have found that 20 genes that are vital to learning, memory, and
							mental flexibility begin to function less efficiently as early as
							age 40. Furthermore, as people age, the specific areas of their
							brains used to accomplish particular tasks changes. For instance,
							older adults use both brain hemispheres for tasks that in younger
							people involve just one hemisphere (<a

							suggests there are four reasons why this discrepancy exists.
							First, it is possible that typical measures of cognitive skills
							tap a different type of cognition than what is required to be
							successful in certain occupations. Recall the discussion of
							practical intelligence, in which we found that traditional IQ
							tests fail to measure cognitive abilities that are related to
							occupational success. Perhaps we would find no discrepancy between
							intelligence and cognitive abilities in midlife if we used
							measures of practical intelligence rather than traditional IQ
							tests to assess intelligence.

						>
							A second factor also relates to the measurement of IQ and
							occupational success. It is possible that the most successful
							middle-aged adults are not representative of midlife adults in
							general. It may be that only a small proportion of people are
							highly successful, and the rest, who experience only moderate or
							little success, have changed occupations, retired, or become sick
							and died. Highly successful people, then, may be an
							unrepresentative sample.

						>
							Also, the degree of cognitive ability required for professional
							success may simply not be that high. According to this argument,
							people can succeed professionally and still be on the decline in
							certain cognitive abilities. In other words, they have brains to
							spare.

						>
							Finally, it may be that older people are successful because they
							have developed specific kinds of expertise and particular
							competencies. Whereas IQ tests measure reactions to novel
							situations, occupational success may be influenced by specific,
							well-practiced abilities. Consequently, middle-aged individuals
							may maintain and even expand the distinctive talents they need for
							professional accomplishment, despite a decline in overall
							intellectual skills. This explanation has generated research on
							expertise.
