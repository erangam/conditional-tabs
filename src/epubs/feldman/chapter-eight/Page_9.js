							Gina, like many people in midlife, enjoys challenging her mind and
							keeping it sharp. She feels confident to take on people half her
							age in a contest of wits and quick response time. She knows she
							has something that younger contestants do not: decades of life
							experience and knowledge.

							The second module of the chapter focuses on cognitive development
							in middle age. We look at the tricky question of whether
							intelligence declines during the period, and we consider the
							difficulty of answering the question fully. We also examine memory
							and how its capabilities change in middle adulthood.
