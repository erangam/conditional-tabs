								At age 51, Elaine was really looking forward to her
								postmenopausal life. Her youngest child had just left home to
								study art, and she had recently reduced her work schedule to a
								comfortable 30 hours a week. She envisioned the year to come as
								an opportunity for a “second honeymoon” with her husband, Greg,
								with no need for contraceptives or fears of becoming pregnant.

								Her imagined honeymoon quickly evaporated in a heat wave of hot
								flashes and night sweats. Though Elaine recognized these as
								normal symptoms of menopause, she was having to change her
								clothing three or more times a day. And she was having more
								headaches. Her doctor prescribed hormone therapy to replace the
								estrogen she was losing through menopause. The drugs eased her
								symptoms. Four months later, she and Greg booked a month’s
								getaway in Greece.

						Although interest in sex remains fairly high for many people in
						middle adulthood, as Elaine’s story illustrates, the physical
						changes associated with aging, such as menopause for women, can
						throw a curve ball at romance. We will look at some of the factors
						that affect men’s and women’s sexuality in midlife and the roles
						both attitude and prescription drugs can play in alleviating some of
						the problems commonly associated with this life stage.
