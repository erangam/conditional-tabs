						For one thing, they watch television. Middle-aged people average
						around 15 hours of television each week. But adults do much more
						with their leisure time. For many people, midlife offers a renewed
						opportunity to take up activities outside the home. As children
						leave, parents have substantial time to participate in leisure
						activities like sports or participate in town committees.
						Middle-aged adults in the United States spend about 6 hours each
						week socializing (<a

						A significant number of people find leisure so alluring that they

						be quite gratifying. Early retirees tend to be in good health, and

						Although midlife offers the opportunity for more leisure, most
						people report that the pace of their lives does not seem slower.
						Much of their free time is scattered throughout the week in 15- and
						30-minute chunks as they pursue a variety of activities. Thus,
						despite a documented increase of 5 hours of weekly leisure time
						since 1965, many people feel they have no more free time than they
						did previously (<a

						One reason why extra leisure time seems to evaporate is that the
						pace of life in the United States is considerably faster than in
						many countries. By measuring the length of time average pedestrians
						cover 60 feet, the time it takes to purchase a stamp, and the
						accuracy of public clocks, research has compared the tempo of living
						in a variety of countries. According to a composite of these
						measures, the United States has a quicker tempo than many other
						countries, particularly Latin American, Asian, Middle Eastern, and
						African countries. But, many countries outpace the United States.
						Western European countries and Japan move more quickly than the
						United States, with Switzerland ranking first (<a
