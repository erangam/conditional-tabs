							The factors that make a job satisfying change during middle age.
							Younger adults focus on abstract and future-oriented concerns,
							such as the opportunity for advancement or the possibility of
							recognition and approval. Middle-aged employees care more about
							the here-and-now qualities of work. They are more concerned with
							pay, working conditions, and specific policies, such as how
							vacation time is calculated. As at previous stages of life,
							changes in overall job quality are associated with changes in
							stress levels for both men and women (<a

							In general, though, the relationship between age and work is
							positive: The older workers are, the more overall job satisfaction
							they experience. This is not altogether surprising, because
							younger adults who are dissatisfied with their jobs will quit them
							and find new positions that they like better. Also, because older

							be helped to realize that a more feasible goal—such as giving
