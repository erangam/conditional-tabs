						Traditional views of adult personality development have suggested

						Some critics suggest that normative-crisis approaches may be
						outmoded. They arose at a time when society had fairly rigid and
						uniform roles for people. Traditionally, men were expected to work
						and support a family; women were expected to stay at home and take
						care of the children. These roles played out at relatively uniform
						ages.

						Today, there is considerable variety in both the roles and the
						timing. Some people marry and have children at 40. Others have
						children and marry later. Others never marry and live with a partner
						of the same or opposite sex and perhaps adopt a child or forgo
						children altogether. In sum, social changes have called into
						question the normative-crisis models closely tied to age (<a

							spent in generativity—making a contribution to family, community,
							work, and society—or in stagnation. Generative people strive to
							guide and encourage future generations. Often, people find
							generativity through parenting, but other roles can fill this
							need, such as working directly with young people, acting as
							mentors. Or the need for generativity may be satisfied through
							creative and artistic output, seeking to leave a lasting
							contribution. The focus of generativity, then, is beyond the self,

							from their lives, adults also seek to “keep the meaning” by

							realize it is not perfect, they strive to safeguard their world,

							Levinson’s view is that most people are susceptible to a fairly
							profound midlife crisis. Before accepting his perspective, we need
							to consider some critical drawbacks in his research. First, his
							initial theory was based on 40 men, and his work with women was
							conducted years later and, again, on a small sample. Levinson also
							overstated the consistency and generality of the patterns he
							found. In fact, the notion of a universal midlife crisis has come
							under considerable criticism (<a

							Such a view is problematic: The evidence is simply lacking. In
							fact, most research suggests that most people pass into middle age
							with relative ease. The majority regard midlife as a particularly
							rewarding time. If they are parents, the physically demanding
							period of childrearing is usually over, and in some cases children
							have left the home, allowing parents the opportunity to rekindle
							their intimacy. Many people find that their careers have
							blossomed, and they feel quite content with their lives. Focusing
							on the present, they seek to maximize their involvement with
							family, friends, and other social groups. Those who regret the
							course of their lives may be motivated to change directions, and

							In short, the evidence for a midlife crisis experienced by most

							One reason may be that turmoil in middle age is both obvious and
							easily remembered by observers. A 40-year-old man who divorces his
							wife, trades his Toyota Sienna for a red Porsche 911 convertible,
							and marries a much younger woman makes a greater impression than a
							happily married man who remains with his spouse (and Toyota)
							through middle adulthood. We are more likely to notice and recall
							marital difficulties than the lack of them. In this way the myth
							of a blustery and universal midlife crisis is perpetuated. For
							most people, though, a midlife crisis is more the stuff of fiction
							than of reality. In fact, for some people midlife brings few, if
							any, changes. As we consider in the{' '}

								One could draw that conclusion by looking at the women living in
								the Oriya culture in Orissa, India. According to research by
								developmental anthropologist Richard Shweder, who studied how
								high-caste Hindu women view aging, a distinct period of middle
								age does not exist. These women view their life course not by
								chronological age, but by the nature of one’s social
								responsibility, family management issues, and moral sense at a
								given time (<a

								The model of aging of the Oriyan women encompasses two phases of
								life: life in her father’s house (<i data-chaucer-element-id="2fb7743d-95c8-4d4d-8064-65da9776ee3b">
									bapa gharo
								</i>), followed by life in her husband’s mother’s house (<i data-chaucer-element-id="052beec1-985c-4fc9-9bbf-c9d07b459a40">
									sasu gharo
								</i>). These two segments fit the context of Oriyan family life,
								which consists of multigenerational households in which
								marriages are arranged. After they are married, husbands remain
								with their parents and wives are expected to move in with their
								in-laws. Upon marriage, a wife changes social status from a
								child (someone’s daughter) to a sexually active female (a
								daughter-in-law).
							</p>
							<p
								data-chaucer-element-id="b8f50894-1f88-4c8a-bf94-93dc98f7a8d2"

								The shift from child to daughter-in-law typically occurs around
								the ages of 18 or 20. However, chronological age, per se, does
								not mark significant boundaries in life for Oriyan women, nor do
								physical changes, such as the onset of menstruation nor its
								cessation at menopause. It is the change from daughter to
								daughter-in-law that significantly alters social responsibility.
								Women must shift their focus from their own parents to the
								parents of their husband, and they must become sexually active
								to perpetuate the husband’s family line.

								To a Western eye, the life course of these women might seem
								restricted, because they rarely have careers outside the home,
								but Oriyan women do not see themselves in this light. In fact,
								in the Oriya culture, domestic work is highly respected and
								valued. Oriyan women also view themselves as more cultured and
								civilized than men, who must work outside the home.

								The notion of a separate middle age is clearly a cultural
								construction. The significance of a particular age range differs
