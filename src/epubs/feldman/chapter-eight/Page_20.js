						Domestic violence is epidemic in the United States, occurring in
						one-fourth of all marriages. More than half the women who were
						murdered in one recent 10-year period were murdered by a partner.
						Between 21 percent and 34 percent of women will be slapped, kicked,
						beaten, choked, or threatened or attacked with a weapon at least
						once by an intimate partner. In fact, continuing, severe violence
						characterizes close to 15 percent of all marriages in the United
						States. In addition, many women are victims of psychological abuse,
						such as verbal or emotional abuse. Domestic violence is also a
						worldwide problem. Estimates suggest that one in three women around
						the globe experience violent victimization during their lives (<a

						In the United States, no segment of society is immune from spousal
						abuse. Violence occurs across social strata, races, ethnic groups,
						and religions. Both gay and straight partnerships can be abusive. It
						also occurs across genders: Although in most instances, the husband
						is the abuser, in about 8 percent of the cases wives physically
						abuse their husbands (<a

						Certain factors increase the likelihood of abuse. Spousal abuse is
						more apt to occur in large families for whom both financial strain
						and verbal aggression are common. Those husbands and wives who grew
						up in families where violence was present are also more likely to be
						violent themselves (<a

						The factors that put a family at risk are similar to those
						associated with child abuse, another form of family violence. Child
						abuse occurs most frequently in stressful environments, at lower
						socioeconomic levels, in single-parent families, and in situations
						of intense marital conflict. Families with four or more children
						have higher abuse rates, and those with incomes under $15,000 a year
						have seven times the rate of families with higher incomes. But not
						all types of abuse are higher in poorer families: Incest is more
						likely to occur in affluent families (<a
