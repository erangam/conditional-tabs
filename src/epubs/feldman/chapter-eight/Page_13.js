										Geoff Kelvin lives with his spouse Juan, their adopted
										6-year-old son Paul, and Geoff’s dad. When asked how midlife
										is treating him, Geoff, 48, laughs. “I’m in the middle, all
										right,” he says. “The middle of a big, noisy, rich life I
										could not have imagined at 20.” Geoff teaches fifth grade
										and loves it. “Working with kids, being a parent, it keeps
										you on your toes.” Adopting Paul has also opened up his
										personality. “Growing up gay, I kept a bit of distance
										around me,” he admits. “But having a kid puts you smack in
										the center of a social scene where everyone shares this big
										job called parenting. Now, I swap stories and share concerns
										with the other moms and dads.”

										Two years ago, Geoff’s dad suffered a stroke that left him
										partly paralyzed. “We never got along that well. He wasn’t
										too keen on his only son being gay,” Geoff says. “But I
										said, ‘You have to move in. There’s no place else to go.’”
										The first months were bumpy, but then Juan quit his job at a
										drug research company—he was sick of office politics—to stay
										home and write articles about environmental issues. The
										decision worked out well. “Juan was happier, and he had the
										patience to deal with my dad,” Geoff says. “In fact, he
										changed my dad’s views about gays and gay marriage. Now, we
										all get along, and my dad loves to joke that he lives in a
										‘real man cave.’”

							The complex and changing patterns of Geoff and Juan’s family life
							are not unusual: Few lives follow a set, predictable pattern
							through middle adulthood. In fact, one of the remarkable
							characteristics of middle age is its variety, as the paths that
							different people travel continue to diverge. In this module we
							focus on the personality and social development that occurs in
							midlife. We begin by examining the changes that typify this
							period. We also explore some of the controversies in developmental
							psychologists’ understandings of midlife, including whether the
							midlife crisis, a phenomenon popularized in the media, is fact or
							fiction.

							Next we consider the various familial ties that bind people
							together (or come unglued) in middle adulthood, including
							marriage, divorce, the empty nest, and grandparenting. We also
							look at a bleak, but prevalent, side of family relations: family
							violence.

							Finally, the module examines work and leisure in midlife. We
							consider the changing role of work in people’s lives and look at
							work-related problems, such as burnout and unemployment. The
							module concludes with a discussion of leisure time, which becomes
							more important during middle age.
