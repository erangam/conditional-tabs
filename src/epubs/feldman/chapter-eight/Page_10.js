								It began innocently enough. Forty-five-year-old Bina Clingman
								couldn’t remember whether she had mailed the letter that her
								husband had given her, and she wondered, briefly, whether this
								was a sign of aging. The next day, the question recurred when
								she spent 20 minutes looking for a phone number she knew she had
								written down on a piece of paper—somewhere. By the time she
								found it, she was surprised and even a little anxious. “Am I
								losing my memory?” she asked herself, feeling both annoyance and
								a degree of concern.

						Many people in their 40s feel more absentminded than they did 20
						years previously, and they have some concern about becoming less
						mentally able as they age. Common wisdom suggests that people lose
						some mental sharpness in midlife. But how accurate is this notion?
