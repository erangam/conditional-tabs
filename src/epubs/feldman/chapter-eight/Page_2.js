									Kara Miles, 52, takes pride in keeping it all together. “I
									don’t think perfectionist is a dirty word,” she says. Kara
									trained as an architect in college and started her own firm at
									age 27. She raised two children, mostly on her own after
									divorcing her alcoholic husband.

									Kara runs 5 miles each morning, eats a low-calorie,
									high-calcium breakfast, and takes weekly classNamees in modern
									dance, fencing, and Pilates. In the evenings, she reviews the
									designs for various projects proposed by her staff. On
									weekends when she’s not hosting a dinner, she goes to the
									shore with her partner, Stephan.

									Recently, Kara’s firm was challenged by a new architect for a
									major contract. “He was so cocky, this 20-something design
									boy,” she says. “But you can’t beat experience.” Kara’s firm
									won the contract. “And I’ll still be winning them when I’m
									70,” she says. “Age? I don’t believe in it.”

								It is in middle adulthood, roughly the period from age 40 to 65,
								that people often first notice and feel the effects of aging.
								Their bodies and, to some extent, their cognitive abilities
								begin to change in unwelcome ways. Looking at the physical,
								cognitive, and social changes of midlife, however, we see this
								is also a time when many people reach the height of their
								capabilities, when they are engaged in shaping their lives as
								never before.

								We begin the module by considering physical development. We
								consider changes in height, weight, and strength, and discuss
								the subtle declines in various senses.

								We also look at sexuality in middle adulthood. We examine the
								effects of change in hormone production for both men and
								women—particularly, menopause—and the various therapies
								available to ease this transition. We consider, too, the role
								attitude plays.

								We then examine both health and illness in midlife. We consider
								the impact of stress and pay special attention to two major
								health problems—heart disease and cancer.
