						For many parents, a major midlife transition is the departure of
						children who are going to college, getting married, joining the
						military, or taking a job far from home. Even people who become
						parents at relatively late ages are likely to face this transition,
						because the middle adulthood spans nearly a quarter century. As we

						wrenching—so much so, in fact, that it has been labeled the “empty

						Most research on the so-called empty nest syndrome has focused on
						women. Men, traditionally not as involved in childrearing, were
						assumed to weather the transition more smoothly. However, some
						research suggest that men also experience feelings of loss when
						their children depart, although these feelings may differ from those

						Helicopter parenting first became apparent when parents
						micro-managed their children’s college careers, complaining to
						instructors and administrators about poor grades that their children
						received or seeking to get them into certain classes. In some cases,
						the phenomenon extends to the workplace; some employers complain
						that parents call human relations departments to extoll the virtues

						Although statistics about the prevalence of helicopter parenting are
						hard to come by, it is clear that the phenomenon is real. One survey
						of 799 employers found that nearly one-third said that parents had
						submitted resumes for their child, sometimes not even informing
						their son or daughter. One-quarter said that parents had contacted
						them, urging them to hire their son or daughter. And 4 percent said
						that a parent had accompanied the child on a job interview. Some

						In most cases, though, parents permit their children to develop

							The sandwich generation is a relatively new phenomenon, produced
							by several converging trends. First, people are marrying later and
							having children at an older age. At the same time, people are
							living longer. Thus, it is not unlikely that midlife adults will
							have parents who are alive and require care while they still have
							children who need a significant amount of nurturing.

							The care of aging parents can be psychologically tricky. There is

							and parents becoming more dependent. As we’ll discuss later,

							Black grandparents are more apt to be involved than white

							greater prevalence of multigenerational households among African

							families are more likely to be headed by single parents. Thus,
							they often rely substantially on the help of grandparents in
							everyday child care, and cultural norms tend to be highly
							supportive of grandparents taking an active role (<a
