						Fifty years ago, midlife was similar for most people. Men and women,
						married since early adulthood, were still married to each other. One
						hundred years ago, when life expectancy was much shorter, people in
						their 40s were usually married—but not necessarily to the people
						they had first married. Spouses often died; people might be well
						into their second marriage by middle age.

						Today, the story is different and more varied. More people are
						single at midlife, having never married. Single people may live
						alone or with a partner. Gay and lesbian adults may have committed
						relationships and may be married. Among heterosexuals, some have
						divorced, lived alone, and then remarried. Many people’s marriages
						end in divorce, and many families “blend” together into new
						households, containing children and stepchildren from previous
						marriages. Some couples still spend 40 to 50 years together, the
						bulk of those years during middle adulthood. Many experience the
						peak of marital satisfaction during middle age.

										For many couples, marital satisfaction falls and rises in a
										U-shaped configuration. It begins to decline after the birth
										of children but increases when the youngest child leaves
										home and eventually returns to a level of satisfaction
										similar to that at the start of marriage. Why do you think

							We don’t know enough to reject the U-shaped view of marital
							satisfaction, and it may be that personality differences account
							for the discrepancy in findings. What is clear is that middle-aged
							couples cite several sources of marital satisfaction. For
							instance, both men and women typically state that their spouse is
							“their best friend” and that they like their spouses as people.
							They also view marriage as a long-term commitment and agree on
							their aims and goals. Finally, most also feel that their spouses
							have grown more interesting over the course of the marriage (<a

							There are many reasons why marriages unravel. One is that people
							spend less time together in middle adulthood than in earlier
							years. In individualistic Western cultures, people are concerned
							with their personal happiness. If their marriage is not
							satisfying, they feel that divorce may increase their happiness.
							Divorce is also more socially acceptable than in the past, and
							there are fewer legal impediments to it. In some cases—but
							certainly not all—the financial costs are not high. And, as the
							opportunities for women grow, wives may feel less dependent on
							their husbands, both emotionally and economically (<a

							Another reason for divorce is that romantic, passionate feelings
							may fade over time. Because Western culture emphasizes the
							importance of romance and passion, members of marriages in which
							passion has declined may feel that that is a sufficient reason to
							divorce. In some marriages, it is a lack of excitement and boredom
							that leads to marital dissatisfaction. In addition, there is a
							great deal of stress in households in which both parents work, and
							this stress puts a strain on marriages. Much of the energy
							directed toward families and maintaining relationships in the past
							is now directed toward work and other institutions outside the
							home (<a

							There are several reasons marrying again may be more appealing
							than remaining single. A person who remarries avoids the social
							consequences of divorce. Even in the twenty-first century, when
							divorce is common, it carries with it a certain stigma. In
							addition, divorced people overall report less satisfaction with
							life than married people (<a

							Second marriages differ from first marriages. Older couples tend
							to be more mature and realistic in their expectations. They often
							view marriage in less romantic terms than younger couples, and
							they are more cautious. They are also likely to be more flexible
							about roles and duties; they share household chores and decision
							making more equitably (<a

							Unfortunately, this doesn’t guarantee second marriages will last.
							The divorce rate is slightly higher than for first marriages. One
							factor that explains this is that second marriages may include
							stresses not present in first marriages, such as the blending of
							different families. Another reason is that having experienced and
							survived one divorce, partners may be less committed and more
							ready to walk away from an unhappy second marriage. Finally, they
							may have personality and emotional characteristics that don’t make
							them easy to live with (<a
