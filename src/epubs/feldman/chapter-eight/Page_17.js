								For Kathy and Bob, going to their son Jon’s college orientation
								was a shockingly new experience in the life of their family. It
								hadn’t really registered that he would be leaving home when he
								was accepted at a college on the other side of the country. It
								didn’t hit them just how much this would change their family
								until they said good-bye and left him on his new campus. It was
								a wrenching experience. Kathy and Bob worried about their son in
								the ways that parents always do, but they also felt a profound
								loss—their job of raising their son, basically, was done. Now he
								was largely on his own. This thought filled them with pride and
								anticipation for his future, but with great sadness, too. They
								would miss him.

						For members of many non-Western cultures who live in extended
						families in which multiple generations spend their lives in the same
						household or village, middle adulthood is nothing special. But in
						Western cultures, family dynamics change significantly in midlife.
						For most parents, there are major shifts in their relationships with
						their children, and with other family members as well. It is a
						period of changing roles that, in twenty-first-century Western
						cultures, encompasses an increasing number of combinations and
						permutations. We’ll start by looking at how marriage develops and
						changes over this period, and then consider some of the many
						alternative forms of family life today (<a
