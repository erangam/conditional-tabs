								reason for her pending surgery was more surprising still. It was
								not that she had breast cancer; in fact, she didn’t. It was that
								she was very likely to develop it at some point in her lifetime.
								Jolie, whose own mother died of ovarian cancer in her mid-50s,
								had requested a genetic test that revealed the presence of a
								rare mutation in a gene that helps suppress tumors. Its presence
								meant that Jolie’s risk of breast cancer was nearly 90 percent.
								Fearing the early demise her mother suffered, Jolie made the
								personal decision to have a preventative double mastectomy,
								which reduced her risk of breast cancer to just 5 percent (<a

								But the outcome is often not as clear as hers was. Many diseases
								are associated with multiple gene variants, complicating the
								results. Sometimes the test reveals a mutation that has an
								unknown impact on disease risk. And often there are
								environmental and lifestyle risk factors that are just as
								important as genetic ones. Even when a test does show an

								Medical experts are therefore concerned about the publicity
								genetic testing is getting and whether it provides a full and

								are often much more easily swayed by vivid anecdotal experiences
								of people they know than by dry statistics. Important healthcare
								decisions may be made more on the basis of fear than any real
