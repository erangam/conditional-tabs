							cultural universal
						</a>, a cultural trait common to all humans: As far as we know, all
						human societies throughout history have used language to communicate
						with each other. Some linguists have even argued that language is
						the fundamental building block of thought—that if you don’t have a
						word for something, you literally can’t think it. The implication of
						this view is that a group’s language is directly responsible for
						many of its cultural symbols and practices. A simple example is the
						distinction between two different words for “you” in French: an

						would possibly place less emphasis on formality in their
						communication with each other and hence in their group culture. But

							mass communication
						</a>. In recent history, mass communication has occurred primarily
						through the mass media: television, radio, and newspapers. At their
						peak, tens of millions of Americans watched the same nightly news
						broadcasts, and millions read the same daily newspaper in large
						metropolitan areas. To be sure, even prior to the emergence of the
						mass media, meaning was still communicated on a large scale, just
						not quite as large or as quickly; the Balinese cockfight could be
						considered a form of mass communication at a smaller scale, for
						example, as could a minister giving a sermon to a large
						congregation.
					</p>

					<p data-chaucer-element-id="203cf5f3-a4ce-42b2-acac-b6fe590ead5d">
						The Internet has emerged as the main medium for mass communication
						today. People increasingly access traditional media sources online
						via newspaper websites or video sources such as Hulu and YouTube. In
						so doing, they also transform formerly passive media consumption (as
						represented by a printed newspaper or television news) into
						something they can participate in by writing comments, reposting
						stories, and blogging. Old media and new media now blur together
						(Jenkins 2006). But the Internet has also created a whole new set of
						communication possibilities only loosely tied to previous forms of
						mass communication, most notably through messaging and platforms
						like Twitter.

					<p data-chaucer-element-id="e3c20117-cebc-4419-a4f5-de0203c7aa36">
						Social media have altered the way children, adults, and
						(increasingly) the elderly engage with each other, both online and
						in person and at distances near and far. They have changed the ways
						corporations as well as anticorporate activists operate, the ways
						that charitable organizations raise funds (especially after a
						catastrophe), the ways that political officials campaign and govern,
						and the ways that social movements organize. They have affected the
						ways we get, and sometimes even make, news and entertainment.
						Cultural sociologists are curious about how and to what extent
						social media have transformed everyday life for people at different
						ages and in different places, as well as about how the rising use of
						social media will affect our interest in other kinds of media, from
						newspapers to telephones and radios to books.
