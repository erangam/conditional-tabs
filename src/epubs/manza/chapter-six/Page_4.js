					that communicate an idea while being distinct from the idea itself.
					Some are straightforward: For example, in contemporary American
					society, a red heart implies love and a green traffic light tells you
					that you are allowed to drive. Other symbols are less obvious: When a
					car commercial shows a car driving off-road at high speeds, it is
					likely that the advertiser is trying to make you think about freedom
					and excitement and associate those ideas with the car. A national flag
					might have a number of different meanings for different people.
					Symbols, whether simple or complex, are things that communicate
					implicit meaning about an idea. Taken together, a group’s symbols are
					an important part of its culture.

					We can analyze and interpret collective symbols to learn about
					particular cultures. The anthropologist Clifford Geertz demonstrated
					the idea that culture is a system of collective meaning by analyzing a
					Balinese cockfight in 1950s Indonesia (Geertz 1972).

					Symbols always exist in specific social contexts—a green traffic light
					would be mysterious to someone raised in a society without cars, for
					example, while most of us would find the rituals of a Balinese
					cockfight equally mysterious. For this reason, studying symbols helps
					us understand things about society that are not often discussed, such
					as distinctions of honor, inequality, and competition. For instance,
					if Geertz had asked them directly, the Balinese cockfighters would not
					have told him that betting was more a status issue than a financial
					one. That was something that he could only perceive through careful
					observation of a place where he had moved and a group that he had
					gotten to know well. This research method, based on lengthy and
					intimate observation of a group, is called{' '}

					How could we use Geertz’s insights to interpret the collective symbols
					of the contemporary United States? In the place of a cockfight, we
					could study the Super Bowl—the most-watched cultural event in the
					country, which features familiar rituals and symbols such as betting
					on the outcome, Super Bowl parties with friends and family, an
					elaborate half-time show, and blockbuster television ads. But
					collective symbols don’t have to be massive spectacles to be
					meaningful. Nowadays we might focus on different cultural events, such
					as trending video clips on YouTube, which would uncover a different
					America. From music videos to people filming their cats to
					back-and-forth video debates about politics or technology, sites such
					as YouTube display our new collective symbols by allowing people to
					share and interpret culture together (Burgess and Green 2009).
