					In the early twentieth century, sociologists and anthropologists
					generally defined culture as the entire way of life of a people. If
					you were transported back to ancient Rome, what kinds of things would
					you need to fit in? You would certainly need language and information
					about art, customs, and traditions. But you would also need all sorts
					of material objects, including clothing, tools, and a place to live.
					This was all considered part of a societyâ€™s culture: both material and
					nonmaterial aspects. Can you identify which aspects of the following
					photo are examples of material culture and which represent nonmaterial
					culture?
