					of it.

					The influential work of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu developed

					Bourdieu’s concept of habitus helps explain how our future choices and
					opinions are always guided by our past experiences. Someone raised in
					a wealthy family on the Upper West Side of Manhattan will have no
					trouble fitting in at a fancy dinner party but perhaps quite a bit of
					trouble fitting in on a farm, while someone raised on a farm will have
					the opposite experience. But people are exposed to all sorts of
					different cultural systems and forms of meaning, after all. So how is
					it that you choose to act one way at one time and a different way at

					If a friend introduces you to someone, how do you behave? If you’re
					single and interested in flirting, you’ll draw on one set of cultural
					tools you’ve developed; if you’re just trying to be polite, you’ll
					draw on a different set of tools. Just as a car mechanic has a box of
					tools at her disposal for fixing a variety of problems, people have a
					kind of tool kit of behaviors and opinions that they apply to
					different situations they find themselves in. Some people will have
					better tools for certain situations, and some people will have better
					tools for others. What’s more, even though people immersed in the same
					cultural environments will tend to have similar cultural tools in
					their tool kit, they probably will have quite different levels of
					expertise and familiarity with the tools. So two people who hang out
					in similar social circles might have the same basic set of
					conversational tools in their cultural tool kits, but the one who
					keeps to himself will be less comfortable using them than the one who
					frequently chats with people she doesn’t know very well.

					One researcher studying love in contemporary America found that the
					two most important cultural tools are the idea of love as a voluntary
					choice and the idea of love as creating a set of commitments to
					another person (Swidler 2003). Most Americans have both of these
					tools, or ways of understanding love, available to them. But their
					personal backgrounds will affect which one they tend to rely on and
					which one they are more competent with. Your own past experiences with
					love might make you leery of thinking of it in terms of commitment, so
					this will change how you navigate future romantic encounters. Or you
					may not have had much experience with commitment, such that when you
					try to use that cultural tool you don’t do a good job of it. From this
					perspective, culture does not just establish differences in how we
					interpret the world and give it meaning but rather influences what
					kinds of strategies and actions are practically available to us.
