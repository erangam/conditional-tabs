When taken for pleasure, to get “high,” or to dull psychological pain or when taken without the supervision of a qualified medical professional, these drugs can pose serious risks to one’s health and may even cause death. One danger of such drugs is their potential to create either a physical or psychological dependence, both of which can lead to a lifelong pattern of abuse as well as the risk of taking increasingly larger doses, leading to one of the clearest dangers of dependence: a drug overdose. Drug overdoses do not happen only with illegal drugs; even certain additives in so-called natural supplements can have a deadly effect. One survey found that more than 23,000 emergency room visits per year could be attributed to the use and abuse of dietary supplements (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000858F">Geller et al., 2015</a>).</p>

Depending on the drug, these symptoms can range from headaches, nausea, and irritability to severe pain, cramping, shaking, and dangerously elevated blood pressure. These physical sensations occur because the body is trying to adjust to the absence of the drug. Many users will take more of the drug to alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal, which makes the entire situation worse. This is actually an example of <i>negative reinforcement</i>, the tendency to continue a behavior that leads to the removal of or escape from unpleasant circumstances or sensations. Negative reinforcement is a very powerful motivating factor, and scores of drug-dependent users exist as living proof of that power.

Drugs that can lead to dependence cause the release of dopamine in a part of the brain called the mesolimbic pathway, a neural track that begins in the midbrain area (just above the pons, an area called the <i>ventral tegmental area</i> or <i>VTA</i>) and connects to limbic system structures, including the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the <i>nucleus accumbens</i>, and continues to the middle of the prefrontal cortex (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008749">Hnasko et al., 2010</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008FD3">Salgado &amp; Kaplitt, 2015</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000009029">Schmitt &amp; Reith, 2010</a>).

When a drug enters the body, it goes quickly to this area, known as the brain’s “reward pathway,” causing a release of dopamine and intense pleasure (see <a className="xref" href="#P7001012078000000000000000001F0C"><span className="label">Figure</span> <span className="number">4.5</span></a>). The brain tries to adapt to this large amount of dopamine by decreasing the number of synaptic receptors for dopamine. The next time the user takes the drug, he or she needs more of it to get the same pleasure response because of the reduced number of receptors—drug tolerance has developed (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008967">Koob &amp; Le Moal, 2005</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000089F9">Laviolette et al., 2008</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008FCF">Salamone &amp; Correa, 2012</a>).

The body may not need or crave the drug, and people may not experience the symptoms of physical withdrawal or tolerance, but they will continue to use the drug because they <i>think</i> they need it. In this case, it is the rewarding properties of using the drug that cause a dependency to develop. This is an example of <i>positive reinforcement</i>, or the tendency of a behavior to strengthen when followed by pleasurable consequences.
