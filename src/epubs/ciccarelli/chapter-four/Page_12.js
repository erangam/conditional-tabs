People of ancient times tried to find meaning in dreams. Some viewed dreams as prophecy, some as messages from the spirits. But the real inquiry into the process of dreaming began with the publication of Freud’s <cite>The Interpretation of Dreams</cite> (1900).</p>

These early traumas were seen as the cause of behavior problems in adulthood, in which his patients suffered from symptoms such as a type of paralysis that had no physical basis or repetitive, ritualistic<a className="noteref noteref_footnote" href="#ritualistic"><i className="icon-info-sign info" /><span className="reader-only">more info</span></a> hand washing. One of the ways Freud devised to get at these early memories was to examine the dreams of his patients, believing that conflicts, events, and desires of the past would be represented in symbolic<a className="noteref noteref_footnote" href="#symbolic"><i className="icon-info-sign info" /><span className="reader-only">more info</span></a> form in the dreams. Freud believed dreams to be a kind of wish fulfillment for his patients.

For example, if Chad has a dream in which he is trying to climb out of a bathtub, the manifest content of the dream is exactly that—he’s trying to climb out of a bathtub.</p>

He believed that the true meaning of a dream was hidden, or <i>latent</i>, and only expressed in symbols. In the dream, the water in the tub might symbolize the waters of birth, and the tub itself might be his mother’s womb. Using a Freudian interpretation, Chad may be dreaming about being born.</p>

But there are still some people who insist that dreams have symbolic meaning. For example, dreaming about being naked in a public place is very common, and most dream analyzers interpret that to mean feeling open and exposed, an expression of childhood innocence, or even a desire for sex. Exactly how the dream is interpreted depends on the other features of the dream and what is happening in the person’s waking life.</p>

Because those signals come from the real world, this process results in an experience of reality. But when people are asleep, the signals from the brain stem are random and not necessarily attached to actual external stimuli, yet the brain must somehow interpret these random signals. It <i>synthesizes</i> (puts together) an explanation of the cortex’s activation from memories and other stored information.</p>

It is less realistic because it comes not from the outside world of reality but from within people’s memories and experiences of the past. The frontal lobes, which people normally use in daytime thinking, are more or less shut down during dreaming, which may also account for the unrealistic and often bizarre nature of dreams (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008AF1">Macquet &amp; Franck, 1996</a>).</p>

A survey questioning subjects about their dream content, for example, concluded that much of the content of dreams is meaningful, consistent over time, and fits in with past or present emotional concerns rather than being bizarre, meaningless, and random (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008359">Domhoff, 1996</a>, <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000835B">2005</a>).</p>

In this newer version, information that is accessed during waking hours can have an influence on the synthesis of dreams. In other words, when the brain is “making up” a dream to explain its own activation, it uses meaningful bits and pieces of the person’s experiences from the previous day or the last few days rather than just random items from memory.</p>
