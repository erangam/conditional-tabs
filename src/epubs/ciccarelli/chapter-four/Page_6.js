People can try to stay awake, and sometimes they may go for a while without sleep, but eventually they <em>must</em> sleep. One reason for this fact is that sleep is one of the human body’s <i>biological rhythms</i>, natural cycles of activity that the body must go through. Some biological rhythms are monthly, like the cycle of a woman’s menstruation, whereas others are far shorter—the beat of the heart is a biological rhythm. But many biological rhythms take place on a daily basis, like the rise and fall of blood pressure and body temperature or the production of certain body chemicals (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008C6F">Moore-Ede et al., 1982</a>).

The release of melatonin is influenced by a structure deep within the tiny hypothalamus in an area called the <i>suprachiasmatic</i> (SOO-prah-ki-AS-ma-tik) <i>nucleus</i>, the internal clock that tells people when to wake up and when to fall asleep (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008559">Gandhi et al., 2015</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008E87">Quintero et al., 2003</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000093D1">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000009421">Zisapel, 2001</a>). The suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, is sensitive to changes in light. As daylight fades, the SCN tells the pineal gland (located in the base of the brain) to secrete melatonin (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008019">Bondarenko, 2004</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000082FF">Delagrange &amp; Guardiola-Lemaitre, 1997</a>). As melatonin accumulates, a person will feel sleepy. As the light coming into the eyes increases (as it does in the morning), the SCN tells the pineal gland to stop secreting melatonin, allowing the body to awaken. That’s a lot of control for such a small part of the brain.</p>

There is some evidence that melatonin may be linked to a healthier metabolism (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008121">Cardinali et al., 2013</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008559">Gandhi et al., 2015</a>). It may help people who suffer from sleep problems due to shift work. Shift-work sleep problems, often attributed to the custom of having workers change shifts against their natural circadian rhythms (e.g., from a day shift to a night shift, and then back again to an evening shift), have been linked to increased accident rates, increased absence from work due to illness, and lowered productivity rates (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000084D5">Folkard &amp; Tucker, 2003</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000084CF">Folkard et al., 1993</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000084D3">Folkard et al., 2005</a>). In addition to melatonin supplements, it has been found that gradually changing the shifts that workers take according to the natural cycle of the day (e.g., from day shift to evening shift to night shift, rather than from day shift directly to night shift) has significantly reduced the problems (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000082AB">Czeisler et al., 1982</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000084D1">Folkard et al., 2006</a>).</p>

Several neurotransmitters are associated with arousal and sleep regulation, including serotonin. It was once theorized that serotonin promoted sleepiness. However, it is not that simple. Serotonin-producing neurons are most active during wakefulness, less active during deep sleep, and relatively inactive during the type of sleep in which dreams typically occur (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008403">Elmenhorst et al., 2012</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008791">Hornung, 2012</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000090C5">Siegel, 2011</a>). Furthermore, effects differ based on which serotonin-producing cells are firing and which brain structures are receiving those messages. Last, some serotonin receptors are excitatory and others are inhibitory. For example, some receptors facilitate some stages of sleep, while others inhibit other stages (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000090C5">Siegel, 2011</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000940D">Zhang et al., 2015</a>).</p>

The suprachiasmatic nucleus, as part of the hypothalamus, controls body temperature. The higher the body temperature, the more alert people are; the lower the temperature, the sleepier they are. When people are asleep at night, their body temperature is at its lowest level. Be careful: The research on the effects of serotonin and body temperature on sleep is correlational, so we cannot assume causation, and there are many different factors involved in sleep.
