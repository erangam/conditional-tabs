A night terror is essentially a state of panic experienced while sound asleep. People may sit up, scream, run around the room, or flail at some unseen attacker. It is also not uncommon for people to feel unable to breathe while they are in this state. Considering that people suffering a night-terror episode are in a deep stage of sleep and breathing shallowly, one can understand why breathing would seem difficult when they are suddenly active. Most people do not remember what happened during a night-terror episode, although a few people can remember vividly the images and terror they experienced.</p>

Nightmares are usually vividly remembered immediately upon waking. A person who has had a nightmare, unlike a person experiencing a night terror, will actually be able to awaken and immediately talk about the bad dream. Perhaps the most telling difference is that nightmares occur during REM sleep rather than deep NREM, slow wave sleep, which is the domain of night terrors, which means that people don’t move around in a nightmare as they do in a night-terror experience.</p>

Sleepwalking is at least partially due to heredity, with greatest risk for children of parents who are or were sleepwalkers (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008883">Kales et al., 1980</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008DF5">Petit et al., 2015</a>). The prevalence for children without parents having a history of sleepwalking is 22.5 percent, increasing to 47.4 percent where one parent did, and reaches 61.5 percent for children where both parents were sleepwalkers. In other words, children with one or both parents having a history of sleepwalking are three to seven times more likely to be sleepwalkers themselves (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008DF5">Petit et al., 2015</a>). A person who is sleepwalking may do nothing more than sit up in bed. But other episodes may involve walking around the house, looking in the refrigerator or even eating, and getting into the car. Most people typically do not remember the episode the next day. One student said that her brother walked in his sleep, and one morning his family found him sound asleep behind the wheel of the family car in the garage. Fortunately, he had not been able to find the keys in his sleep.</p>

Many parents have found that preventing sleep loss makes sleepwalking a rare occurrence. This is most likely due to the deeper stage N3 sleep becoming even deeper during sleep loss, which would make fully waking even more difficult (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008E21">Pilon et al., 2008</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000093EF">Zadra et al., 2008</a>, <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000093ED">2013</a>). The only real precaution that the families of people who sleepwalk should take is to clear their floors of obstacles and to put not-easy-to-reach locks on the doors. And although it is typically not dangerous to wake sleepwalkers, they may strike out before awakening.</p>

Gerald could give a jet engine some serious competition. Snoring is fairly common, occurring when the breathing passages (nose and throat) get blocked. Most people snore only when they have a cold or some other occasional problem, but some people snore every night and quite loudly, like Gerald. It is this type of snoring that is often associated with a condition called <a className="keyword" id="P7001012078000000000000000001D25" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000001D25" href="./#/ciccarelli/glossary#P7001012078000000000000000007C54">sleep apnea</a>, in which the person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. When breathing stops, there will be a sudden silence, followed shortly by a gasping sound as the person struggles to get air into the lungs. Many people do not wake up while this is happening, but they do not get a good, restful night’s sleep because of the apnea.</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000AE85" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000AE85">Apnea is a serious problem. According to the <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008CE9">National Institutes of Health (2011)</a>, from 5 to 25 percent of adults in the United States suffer from apnea (it is difficult to be precise, as many people are unaware that they have apnea). Apnea can cause heart problems as well as poor sleep quality and depression (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000083D3">Edwards et al., 2015</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000084BF">Flemons, 2002</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008CD1">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2015</a>). If a person suspects the presence of apnea, a visit to a physician is the first step in identifying the disorder and deciding on a treatment. While some people can benefit from wearing a nasal opening device, losing weight (obesity is often a primary cause of apnea), or using a nasal spray to shrink the nasal tissues, others must sleep with a device that delivers a continuous stream of air under mild pressure, called a <i>continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device</i>. Still others undergo a simple surgery in which the <i>uvula</i> (the little flap that hangs down at the back of the throat) and some of the soft tissues surrounding it are removed.</p>

These infants are typically placed on monitors that sound an alarm when breathing stops, allowing caregivers to help the infant begin breathing again. Although sleep apnea in infants is often associated with sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, it is not necessarily caused by it: Many infants who die of SIDS were never diagnosed with sleep apnea (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000007FE1">Blackmon et al., 2003</a>).</p>

Another symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness that results in the person falling asleep throughout the day at inappropriate times and in inappropriate places (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008D91">Overeem et al., 2001</a>). These sleep attacks may occur many times and without warning, making the operation of a car or other machinery very dangerous for the person with narcolepsy. The sudden REM attacks are especially dangerous because of the symptom of <i>cataplexy</i>, or a sudden loss of muscle tone. This sleep paralysis may cause injuries if the person is standing when the attack occurs. The same hypnogogic images that may accompany stage N1 sleep may also occur in the person with narcolepsy. There may be new hope for sufferers of narcolepsy: Researchers have been developing a new drug to treat narcolepsy, and while still in the stages of animal testing, it looks very promising (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008CC1">Nagahara et al., 2015</a>). <a className="xref" href="#P7001012078000000000000000001D38"><span className="label">Table</span> <span className="number">4.1</span></a> has a more detailed list of known sleep disorders.</p>

							<p>Concept Map 4.3 to 4.6 describes the following features of Sleep (one of the body's daily [circadian] biological rhythms; sleep–wake cycle controlled by the brain including the hypothalamus and the neurotransmitter serotonin).</p>
							<ul>
								<li>hypothalamus contains the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
									<ul>
										<li>SCN is sensitive to light—influences pineal gland’s secretion of melatonin; increased melatonin leads to increased sleepiness</li>
										<li>light through eyes relayed to SCN; SCN signals pineal gland to stop producing melatonin; decreased melatonin leads to increased alertness and decreased sleepiness</li>
										<li>SCN also influences body temperature; lower temperature leads to increased sleepiness</li>
									</ul></li>
								<li>people can live without sleep for a while, can’t live without it altogether
									<ul>
										<li><b>sleep deprivation</b> can lead to serious changes in body and mental functioning</li>
										<li><b>amount of sleep needed</b> ranges from 4 to 10 hours; most people need 7 to 9 hours every 24 hours</li>
										<li><b>adaptive theory of sleep</b> suggests sleep is a product of evolution; sleep has evolved to avoid the active time of predators</li>
										<li><b>restorative theory of sleep</b> suggests sleep is vital to the physical health of the body; body growth and repair occur during the deepest stages of sleep</li>
									</ul></li>
								<li>consists of both REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM stages; REM is relatively active whereas non-REM is much deeper and restful; stages defined by level of brain activity as measured by the EEG (beta, alpha, theta, delta waves); sleep cycle is made up of various stages repeated 4 to 5 times a night
									<ul>
										<li><b>N1:</b> while awake, primarily beta activity, more alpha as one relaxes, onset of sleep in Stage 1 is associated with alpha being replaced by theta</li>
										<li><b>N2:</b> EEG sleep spindles appear; theta activity is predominant; body temperature continues to drop, heart rate and breathing slow</li>
										<li><b>N3:</b> deepest stage of sleep; delta activity makes up 20 percent to more than 50 percent of EEG activity; body is at lowest level of functioning and people are hard to awaken; sleep disorders such as sleepwalking and night terrors occur in this stage</li>
										<li><b>R:</b> dreaming occurs, including nightmares; eyes move rapidly under the eyelids and EEG indicates presence of beta, but body is typically still, due to sleep paralysis; REM behavior disorder occurs when body is not still or acts out dreams, usually seen in men over age 60</li>
									</ul></li>
								<li>sleep disorders include a variety of problems that can interfere with sleep
									<ul>
										<li><b>insomnia </b>is the inability to get to sleep, stay asleep, or get good quality sleep</li>
										<li><b>sleep apnea </b>consists of loud snoring and stopped breathing</li>
										<li><b>narcolepsy </b>consists of sudden onset of REM sleep during otherwise waking hours</li>
