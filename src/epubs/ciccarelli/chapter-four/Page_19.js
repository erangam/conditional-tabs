In simple terms, stimulants “speed up” the nervous system—the heart may beat faster or the brain may work faster, for example. Many of these drugs are called “uppers” for this reason.</p>

Among the amphetamines are drugs like Benzedrine, Methedrine, and Dexedrine. A related compound, <i>methamphetamine</i>, is sometimes used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy. “Crystal meth” is a crystalline form that can be smoked and is used by “recreational” drug users, people who do not need drugs but instead use them to gain some form of pleasure.</p>

See <a className="xref" href="ch02_pg0008.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000000D3A"><span className="label">Learning Objective</span> <span className="number">2.5</span></a>. Some truck drivers use amphetamines to stay awake while driving long hours. Stimulants won’t give people any extra energy, but they will cause people to burn up whatever energy reserves they do have. They also depress the appetite, which is another function of the sympathetic division. Many doctors used to prescribe these drugs as diet pills. Today they are only used on a short-term basis and under strict medical supervision, often in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008FC7">Safer, 2015</a>). Diet pills sold over the counter usually contain another relatively mild stimulant, caffeine.</p>

Nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, and strokes are possible, as is a state called “amphetamine psychosis.” This condition causes addicts to become delusional (losing contact with what is real) and paranoid. They think people are out to “get” them. Violence is a likely outcome, against both the self and others (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008333">Dickinson, 2015</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008983">Kratofil et al., 1996</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008DAF">Paparelli et al., 2011</a>).</p>

It produces feelings of euphoria (a feeling of great happiness), energy, power, and pleasure. It also deadens pain and suppresses the appetite. It was used rather liberally by both doctors and dentists (who used it in numbing the mouth prior to extracting a tooth, for example) near the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, until the deadly effects of its addictive qualities became known. Many patent medicines contained minute traces of cocaine, including the now famous Coca-Cola™ (this popular soft drink was originally marketed as a nerve tonic). The good news is that even in 1902, there wasn’t enough cocaine in a bottle of cola to affect even a fly, and by 1929, all traces of cocaine were removed (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000007E07">Allen, 1994</a>).</p>

This, of course, is <a className="keyword" id="P7001012078000000000000000001F78" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000001F78" href="./#/ciccarelli/glossary#P7001012078000000000000000007558">caffeine</a>, the stimulant found in coffee, tea, most sodas, energy drinks, chocolate, and even many over-the-counter drugs.</p>

It is a mild stimulant, helps maintain alertness, and can increase the effectiveness of some pain relievers such as aspirin. Caffeine is often added to pain relievers for that reason and is the key ingredient in medications meant to keep people awake.</p>

All one would get is a wide-awake drunk. Coffee is fairly acidic, too, and acids are not what the stomach of a person with a hangover needs. (And since the subject has come up, drinking more alcohol or “hair of the dog that bit you” just increases the problem later on—the best cure for a hangover is lots of water to put back all the fluids that alcohol takes out of the body, and sleep.)</p>
