It’s the same kind of dissociation that takes place when people drive somewhere familiar and then wonder how they got there. One part of the mind, the conscious part, is thinking about dinner or a date or something else, while the other part is doing the actual driving. When people arrive at their destination, they don’t really remember the actual trip. In the same way, Hilgard believes that there is a hidden part of the mind that is very much aware of the hypnotic subject’s activities and sensations, even though the “hypnotized” part of the mind is blissfully unaware of these same things.</p>

There had to be pain—most people can’t even get an ice cube out of the freezer without <i>some</i> pain—but subjects reported no pain at all. The subjects who were successful at denying the pain also reported that they imagined being at the beach or in some other place that allowed them to dissociate<a className="noteref noteref_footnote" href="#dissociate"><i className="icon-info-sign info" /><span className="reader-only">more info</span></a> from the pain.</p>

These participants had no trouble copying many actions previously thought to require a hypnotic state, such as being rigidly suspended between two chairs. The researchers also found that participants who were not familiar with hypnosis and had no idea what the “role” of a hypnotic subject was supposed to be could not be hypnotized.</p>
