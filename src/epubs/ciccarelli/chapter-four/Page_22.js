In more modern times, ghostly visitations have often given way to aliens, who may perform some sort of medical examination or who may abduct the person, only to return them to their beds. And it is to their beds that they are usually returned, and such visitations typically are experienced when the person is in bed. Is there a simpler explanation for these experiences?</p>

The more logical explanation is that they have been startled awake from either a hypnogogic or hypnopompic hallucination experienced at some point as they were sleeping.</p></div></figcaption>

					<p id="P700101207800000000000000000B1A3" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000B1A3">As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a type of hallucination can occur just as a person is entering stage N1 sleep, called a <i>hypnogogic hallucination</i> (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000089CD">Lana-Peixoto, 2014</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008D65">Ohayon et al., 1996</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000090C7">Siegel &amp; West, 1975</a>). If you remember that people in N1, when awakened, will deny having been asleep, a simple explanation for so-called supernatural visitations does present itself. Hypnogogic hallucinations are not dreamlike in nature. Instead, they feel very real to the person experiencing them (who does not think he or she is asleep, remember). Most common are the auditory hallucinations, in which a person might hear a voice calling out the person’s name, not all that unusual and probably not remembered most of the time.</p>
					<p id="P700101207800000000000000000B1A4" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000B1A4">Imagine for a moment, though, that your hypnogogic hallucination is that of some person whom you know to be dead or ill, or a strange and frightening image, perhaps with equally strange and frightening sound effects. That you will remember, especially since you are likely to wake up right after <i>and be completely convinced that you were awake at the time of the hallucination</i>. Combine this experience with the natural tendency many people have to want to believe that there is life after death or that there are other sentient life forms visiting our planet, and <i>voilà!</i>—a ghost/spirit/alien has appeared.</p>
					<p id="P700101207800000000000000000B1A5" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000B1A5">Sometimes people have a similar experience in the middle of the night. They awaken to find that they are paralyzed and that something—ghost, demon, alien—is standing over them and perhaps doing strange things to their helpless bodies. When a hallucination happens just as a person is in the between-state of being in REM sleep (in which the voluntary muscles are paralyzed) and not yet fully awake, it is called a <i>hypnopompic hallucination</i> and is once again a much simpler explanation of visits by aliens or spirits during the night than any supernatural explanation. Such visitations are not as rare as you might think, but once again, it is only the spectacular, frightening, or unusual ones that will be remembered (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000081C3">Cheyne, 2003</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008627">Greeley, 1987</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008B21">Mantoan et al., 2013</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008D65">Ohayon et al., 1996</a>).</p>
