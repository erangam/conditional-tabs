REM sleep is a relatively psychologically active type of sleep when most of a person’s dreaming takes place, whereas NREM sleep spans from lighter stages to a much deeper, more restful kind of sleep. In REM sleep, the voluntary muscles are inhibited, meaning that the person in REM sleep moves very little, whereas in NREM sleep the person’s body is free to move around (including kicking one’s bed partner!). There are also several different stages of sleep that people go through each night in which REM sleep and NREM sleep occur. A machine called an electroencephalograph allows scientists to record the brain-wave activity as a person passes through the various stages of sleep and to determine what type of sleep the person has entered (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000007E93">Aserinsky &amp; Kleitman, 1953</a>).</p>

If you find yourself reading older sleep research and see terms like REM (now R), NREM (now N), or four stages of NREM sleep instead of the three stages we will examine shortly, it is due to this change in the guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000087EF">Iber et al., 2007</a>).</p>

Several rather interesting things can happen in this stage of sleep. If people are awakened at this point, they will probably not believe that they were actually asleep. They may also experience vivid visual events called <i>hypnogogic images</i> or <i>hallucinations</i> (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008963">Kompanje, 2008</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008B6D">Mavromatis, 1987</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008B6F">Mavromatis &amp; Richardson, 1984</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000092D9">Vitorovic &amp; Biller, 2013</a>). (The Greek word <i>hypnos</i> means “sleep.”) Many researchers now believe that people’s experiences of ghostly visits, alien abductions, and near-death experiences may be most easily explained by these hallucinations (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008963">Kompanje, 2008</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008C69">Moody &amp; Perry, 1993</a>).

Have you ever been drifting off to sleep when your knees, legs, or sometimes your whole body gives a big “jerk”? Although experts have no solid proof of why this occurs, many believe that it has something to do with the possibility that our ancestors slept in trees: The relaxation of the muscles as one drifts into sleep causes a “falling” sensation, at which point the body jerks awake to prevent the “fall” from the hypothetical tree (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008247">Coolidge, 2006</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008FC9">Sagan, 1977</a>).</p>

If something does wake them, they may be very confused and disoriented at first. It is not unusual for people to wake up in this kind of disoriented state only to hear the crack of thunder and realize that a storm has come up. Children are even harder to wake up when in this state than are adults. Deep sleep is the time when body growth occurs. This may explain why children in periods of rapid growth need to sleep more and also helps explain why children who are experiencing disrupted sleep (as is the case in situations of domestic violence) suffer delays in growth (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000085C3">Gilmour &amp; Skuse, 1999</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008FED">Saper et al., 2001</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000091D9">Swanson, 1994</a>).</p>

The person is still asleep but in the stage known as rapid eye movement sleep (R) and sometimes referred to as paradoxical sleep.</p>

And why would REM sleep ever be considered restful when the body is almost awake and the brain is so active? REM sleep seems to serve a different purpose than does NREM, or deep sleep. After a very physically demanding day, people tend to spend more time in NREM deep sleep than is usual. But an emotionally stressful day leads to increased time in REM sleep (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000878B">Horne &amp; Staff, 1983</a>). Perhaps the dreams people have in REM sleep are a way of dealing with the stresses and tensions of the day, whereas physical activity would demand more time for recovery of the body in NREM sleep. Also, if deprived of REM sleep (as would occur with the use of sleeping pills or other depressant drugs), a person will experience greatly increased amounts of REM sleep the next night, a phenomenon called <a className="keyword" id="P7001012078000000000000000001CB6" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000001CB6" href="./#/ciccarelli/glossary#P7001012078000000000000000007B8B">REM rebound</a> (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008A8F">Lo Bue et al., 2014</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000092DB">Vogel, 1975</a>, <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000092DD">1993</a>).</p>

This is called the <i>REM myth</i> because later studies failed to reliably produce the same results (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000830B">Dement et al., 1969</a>).</p>

These differences can be explained: When infants are engaged in REM sleep, they are not dreaming but rather forming new connections between neurons (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008137">Carskadon &amp; Dement, 2005</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000082D9">Davis et al., 2004</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000009061">Seehagen et al., 2015</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000090A9">Sheldon, 2002</a>). The infant brain is highly plastic, and much of brain growth and development takes place during REM sleep. See <a className="xref" href="ch02_pg0007.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000000CCA"><span className="label">Learning Objective</span> <span className="number">2.4</span></a>. As the infant’s brain nears its adult size by age 5 or 6, the proportion of REM sleep has also decreased to a more adult-like ratio of REM sleep to NREM sleep. For infants, to sleep is perchance to grow synapses.</p>
