Thoughts may become fuzzy and disorganized, and you may feel less alert, or your thoughts may take bizarre turns, as they so often do in dreams. Sometimes being in an altered state may mean being in a state of <i>increased</i> alertness, as when under the influence of a stimulant. You may also divide your conscious awareness, as when you drive to work or school and then wonder how you got there—one level of conscious awareness was driving, while the other was thinking about the day ahead, perhaps. This altered state of divided consciousness can be a dangerous thing, as many people who try to drive and talk on a cell phone at the same time have discovered. People are often unaware that there are two kinds of thought processes, <i>controlled processes</i> and <i>automatic processes</i> (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000007EFB">Bargh et al., 2012</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000087A9">Huang &amp; Bargh, 2014</a>). Controlled processes are those that require our conscious attention to a fairly high degree, such as driving, carrying on a conversation, or taking notes in your psychology class (you are taking notes, right?). Automatic processes require far less of a conscious level of attention—we are aware of these actions at a low level of conscious awareness, and examples would be brushing one’s hair or well-practiced actions such as walking or riding a bicycle. Driving a car along a familiar path can become fairly automatic, hence the experience of driving somewhere and not knowing how you got there—driving is really a control process, not an automatic one, but we often forget to pay attention to this fact. Controlled processes such as driving or carrying on a conversation should only be done one at a time, while you can do an automatic process and a controlled process at the same time without too much trouble. Talking on a cell phone while brushing your hair is okay, for example, but talking on a cell phone while driving your car is not. Studies have shown that driving while talking on a cell phone, even a hands-free phone, puts a person at the same degree of risk as driving under the influence of alcohol (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000007E17">Alm &amp; Nilsson, 1995</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008073">Briem &amp; Hedman, 1995</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000919F">Strayer &amp; Drews, 2007</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000091A3">Strayer &amp; Johnston, 2001</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000091A1">Strayer et al., 2006</a>, <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000091A5">2014</a>).

If he manages to get himself and his passenger safely to their destination—and by multitasking while driving he is certainly endangering both of their lives, and others as well—it’s possible that he won’t even remember the trip; he may be driving in an altered state of consciousness.</p></div></figcaption>

For example, daydreaming, being hypnotized, or achieving a meditative state are usually considered to be altered states.

Being under the influence of certain drugs such as caffeine, tobacco, or alcohol is definitely an example of altered states. Over several decades, there has been a definite rise in the use of stimulants that would ordinarily be prescribed for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but are also used by college students and older adults who feel that the drugs give them an “edge” (Partnership for <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008DBD">Drug-Free Kids, 2014</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000091E1">Szalavitz, 2009</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000009437">Zuvekas &amp; Vitlielo, 2012</a>). But the most common altered state people experience is the one they spend about a third of their lives in on a nightly basis—sleep.</p>
