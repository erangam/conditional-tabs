It proposes that animals and humans evolved different sleep patterns to avoid being present during their predators’ normal hunting times, which typically would be at night. For example, if a human or a prey animal (one a predator will eat) is out and about at night, they are more at risk of being eaten. However, if during active hunting hours the prey is in a safe place sleeping and conserving energy, it is more likely to remain unharmed. If this theory is true, then one would expect prey animals to sleep mostly at night and for shorter periods of time than predator animals; you would also expect that predators could sleep in the daytime—virtually as much as they want. This seems to be the case for predators like lions that have very few natural predators themselves. Lions will sleep nearly 15 hours a day, whereas animals such as gazelles that are lions’ prey sleep a mere 4 hours a day, usually in short naps. Nocturnal animals such as the opossum can afford to sleep during the day and be active at night (when their food sources are available), because they are protected from predators by sleeping high up in trees (see <a className="xref" href="#P7001012078000000000000000001C3B"><span className="label">Figure</span> <span className="number">4.2</span></a>).</p>
