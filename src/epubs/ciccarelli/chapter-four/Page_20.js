They believe that getting drunk, especially in college, is a ritual of adulthood. Many college students and even older adults engage in binge drinking (drinking four or five drinks within a limited amount of time, such as at “happy hour”). Binge drinking quickly leads to being drunk, and drunkenness is a major sign of alcoholism. Some other danger signs are feeling guilty about drinking, drinking in the morning, drinking to recover from drinking, drinking alone, being sensitive about how much one drinks when others mention it, drinking so much that one does and says things one later regrets, drinking enough to have blackouts or memory loss, drinking too fast, lying about drinking, and drinking enough to pass out.</p>

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000816F">CDC, 2011</a>, <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000817B">2015a</a>), the number of alcohol-related deaths in the period from 2006 to 2010 was around 88,000 deaths. This figure does <em>not</em> include deaths due to accidents and homicides that may be related to abuse of alcohol—only those deaths that are caused by the body’s inability to handle the alcohol. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008CE1">NIAAA, 2016</a>) has statistics showing that nearly 88,000 people <i>per year</i> die from alcohol-related causes, a figure that probably <em>does</em> include those accidents and homicides, making alcohol the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.</p>

							<p><img alt="Small text bubble" height={13} width={12} src={imageOne} /> I have friends who insist that alcohol is a stimulant because they feel more uninhibited when they drink, so why is it considered a depressant?</p>

						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000B09A" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000B09A">Alcohol is often confused with stimulants. Many people think this is because alcohol makes a person feel “up” and euphoric (happy). Actually, alcohol is a depressant that gives the illusion of stimulation, because the very first thing alcohol depresses is a person’s natural inhibitions, or the “don’ts” of behavior. Inhibitions are all the social rules people have learned that allow them to get along with others and function in society. Inhibitions also keep people from taking off all their clothes and dancing on the table at a crowded bar—inhibitions are a good thing.</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000B09B" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000B09B">Many people are unaware of exactly what constitutes a “drink.” <a className="xref" href="#P7001012078000000000000000001FB8"><span className="label">Table</span> <span className="number">4.4</span></a> explains this and shows the effects of various numbers of drinks on behavior. Alcohol indirectly stimulates the release of a neurotransmitter called GABA, the brain’s major depressant (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008071">Brick, 2003</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008FE9">Santhakumar et al., 2007</a>). GABA slows down or stops neural activity. As more GABA is released, the brain’s functioning actually becomes more and more inhibited, depressed, or slowed down. The areas of the brain that are first affected by alcohol are unfortunately the areas that control social inhibitions, so alcohol (due to its simulation of GABA) has the effect of depressing the inhibitions. As the effects continue, motor skills, reaction time, and speech are all affected.</p>

People who are not usually drinkers will feel the effects of alcohol much more quickly than those who have built up a tolerance. Women also feel the effects sooner, as their bodies process alcohol differently than men’s bodies do. (Women are typically smaller, too, so alcohol has a quicker impact on women.)</p>

Highly addictive, it mimics the effects of endorphins, the nervous system’s natural painkillers. The nervous system slows or stops its production of endorphins. When the drug wears off, there is no protection against any kind of pain, causing the severe symptoms of withdrawal associated with these drugs. It was not until 1803 that opium was developed for use as a medication by a German physician. The new form—morphine—was hailed as “God’s own medicine” (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008755">Hodgson, 2001</a>).</p>

Morphine was thought to be a wonder drug, although its addictive qualities soon became a major concern to physicians and their patients. Morphine is still used today to control severe pain, but in carefully controlled doses and for very short periods of time.</p>

The theory was that heroin was a purer form of the drug and that the impurities in morphine were the substances creating the harmful side effects. It did not take long, however, for doctors and others to realize that heroin was even more powerfully addictive than morphine or opium. Although usage as a medicine ceased, it is still used by many people.</p>

People are not only using heroin but are combining it with other drugs, particularly cocaine and prescription painkillers containing opiates, which has of course led to an increase in overdose deaths. The rate of heroin-related overdose deaths quadrupled in only an 11-year period, from 2002–2013 (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008185">CDC, 2015c</a>).</p>
