He collected more than 10,000 dreams and concluded that most dreams reflect the events that occur in everyday life (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000866F">Hall, 1966</a>). Although most people dream in color, people who grew up in the era of black-and-white television sometimes have dreams in black and white. There are gender differences, although whether those differences are caused by hormonal/genetic influences, sociocultural influences, or a combination of influences remains to be seen. In his book <cite>Finding Meaning in Dreams</cite>, <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008359">Dr. William Domhoff (1996)</a> concluded that across many cultures, men more often dream of other males whereas women tend to dream about males and females equally. Men across various cultures also tend to have more physical aggression in their dreams than do women, and women are more often the victims of such aggression in their own dreams. Domhoff also concluded that where there are differences in the content of dreams across cultures, the differences make sense in light of the culture’s “personality.” For example, American culture is considered fairly aggressive when compared to the culture of the Netherlands, and the aggressive content of the dreams in both cultures reflects this difference: There were lower levels of aggression in the dreams of those from the Netherlands when compared to the Americans’ dream content.</p>

Boys and men tend to have more male characters in their dreams, which are also typically in outdoor or unfamiliar settings and may involve weapons, tools, cars, and roads. Men also report more sexual dreams, usually with unknown and attractive partners (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008359">Domhoff, 1996</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000835D">Domhoff &amp; Schneider, 2008</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000084ED">Foulkes, 1982</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008789">Horikawa et al., 2013</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000092B3">Van de Castle, 1994</a>).</p>

Nearly 50 percent of the dreams recorded by <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P700101207800000000000000000866F">Hall (1966)</a> had sexual content, although later research has found lower percentages (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000092B3">Van de Castle, 1994</a>). Then there are dreams of flying, falling, and of trying to do something and failing—all of which are very common dreams, even in other cultures (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008359">Domhoff, 1996</a>). So is that often-recounted dream of being naked in public!

					<p>Concept Map 4.7 to 4.8 describes the following features of Dreams.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Why do we dream?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Freud’s interpretation:</strong> wish fulfillment—conflicts, events, and desires represented in symbolic form in dreams
							<ul>
								<li><strong>manifest content:</strong> actual dream itself</li>
								<li><strong>latent content:</strong> hidden or symbolic meaning of dream</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>activation-synthesis hypothesis</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>dreams are product of random signals (activation), with brain forming explanation of signals based on memories and other information (synthesis)</li>
								<li>activation-information-mode model (AIM) suggests that information access during waking hours can influence the synthesis of dreams</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>What do people dream about?</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>typically about events that occur in everyday life; most in color; content influenced by gender and culture</li>
