There’s even a name for it, the “freshman 15.” Some of the reasons people have given for this weight gain, citing “commonsense” reasoning, include being away from home (and parental supervision) for the first time, more partying than studying, and mass consumption of junk food, among others. But common sense, as we’ve seen, doesn’t always give an accurate picture of what is really happening. For accuracy, we need to determine what science says about the freshman 15.</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000AEEF" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000AEEF">First we need to ask, do first-year college students really put on weight their first year of school? The answer seems to be yes, but not quite as much as rumor has it. The actual freshman weight gain tends to be about 3.5 to 6 pounds (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008773">Holm-Denoma et al., 2008</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008F15">Roane et al., 2015</a>). Score one for science, not so much for common sense.</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000AEF0" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000AEF0">Now that we know there is a weight gain, what could be the cause or causes of that gain? We do know that college students probably don’t get the amount of sleep recommended by experts, which is a little over 9 hours a night (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000082B1">Dahl &amp; Lewin, 2002</a>; <a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008743">Hirshkowitz et al., 2015</a>). Sleep deprivation can make you eat more, and there’s evidence that when teens and young adults are sleep deprived, they tend to go for sweet foods that are high in calories and low in nutrition (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P70010120780000000000000000090DF">Simon et al., 2015</a>).</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000AEF1" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000AEF1">But is it the fewer hours of sleep or the timing of the amount of sleep freshman do get? Students often get to bed much later when away at school than when at home, and one study has shown that for every hour bedtime was pushed back, there was a gain of about two points in body mass index or BMI, an indicator of how much body fat a person has (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000007E8B">Asarnow et al., 2015</a>).</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000AEF2" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000AEF2" data-chaucer-note-id={210040}>A more recent study suggests that in addition to all of these factors, the weight gain experienced by many freshman college students may also be a result of irregular sleep patterns: Not only do students get less sleep and go to bed later, but they also go to sleep at different times due to different class schedules and social activities. While a person who is working has a schedule of getting up at a certain time and going to bed by a certain time on a regular basis, students may get to bed at midnight and get up at 7 <span className="smallcaps">a.m</span>. one night but go to bed at 2 <span className="smallcaps">a.m</span>. the following night and get up at 9 <span className="smallcaps">a.m</span>. Even though both nights are 7 hours of sleep, the shift in the schedule is what may cause more sleep deprivation symptoms, according to a study conducted by researchers at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island (<a className="biblioref" href="./#/ciccarelli/reference#P7001012078000000000000000008F15">Roane et al., 2015</a>). When your sleep–wake cycle is shifted daily by 2 to nearly 3 hours, it’s like having daily jet lag—just like shift workers and frequent flyers.</p>
						<p id="P700101207800000000000000000AEF3" data-uri="M04_CICC7961_05_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000AEF3">So the “freshman fifteen” is real, but more like the “freshman five,” and the causative factors are not as simple as common sense might tell us. The sleep deprivation symptoms brought on by not only less sleep but also frequent variability in sleep cycles lead to fatigue (which leads to less exercise) and eating more sweets for quick energy boosts, eventually leading to weight gain. In the Brown study, this weight gain amounted to about 6 pounds in only 9 weeks!</p>
